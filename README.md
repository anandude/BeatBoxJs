 JSDrumKit is a small web project showcasing a virtual drum kit built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can interact with the drum kit by clicking on the graphical representations of each drum part or by pressing the corresponding keyboard letters. This project serves as a practice exercise for handling keystrokes and button clicks in JavaScript.
